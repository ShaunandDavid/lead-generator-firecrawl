# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: September 25, 2025_

This Privacy Policy describes how Xenteck LLC ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects information in connection with the lead generation tools contained in this repository (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

- **Client-provided inputs:** URLs, directories, ICP guidance, Google Sheet links, and any additional context entered via the UI or CLI.
- **Integration metadata:** Google Sheet IDs, Drive folder IDs, service account email addresses, and run configuration options.
- **Operational telemetry:** Application logs, run metrics, and error reports required to operate, troubleshoot, and improve the Service.

The Service does not intentionally collect end-user personal data beyond what is submitted by the client. Clients are responsible for ensuring that any data they provide complies with applicable privacy and data protection laws.

## 2. How We Use Information

We use the collected information to:

- Execute requested lead discovery and enrichment jobs.
- Deliver results to the client-owned Google Sheets or other configured destinations.
- Maintain, secure, and improve the Service, including debugging, monitoring, and analytics.
- Comply with legal obligations.

## 3. Data Retention

- Run configuration and log files are retained for up to 30 days unless otherwise required for troubleshooting or legal compliance.
- Clients may request earlier deletion of logs or configuration artifacts by contacting support@xenteck.com.
- Output spreadsheets remain under the client's control. Once a run completes, the Service does not retain copies of the generated spreadsheet data.

## 4. Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell or rent client data. Information may be shared with:

- **Service providers** assisting with hosting, logging, or security who are bound by confidentiality obligations.
- **Legal authorities** when required to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes.

## 5. Security

We implement technical and organizational measures to protect data, including limited-access service account credentials, encrypted transport (HTTPS), and audit logging. Despite these measures, no system is completely secure; clients are encouraged to protect access to their Google Sheets and revoke sharing when runs complete.

## 6. Client Responsibilities

Clients must:

- Only submit URLs and data sources they are authorized to process.
- Share Google Sheets or Drive folders with the service account using the least privileges necessary.
- Revoke access to spreadsheets when processing is complete if continued access is not required.

## 7. International Transfers

Depending on hosting location, data may be processed in the United States or other jurisdictions. By using the Service, clients consent to this processing.

## 8. Children's Privacy

The Service is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via commit history and release notes. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
